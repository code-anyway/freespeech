<p t="0" d="1840">Ukrainians!</p>
<p t="1840" d="2560">All our defenders!</p>
<p t="4400" d="3120">The 55th day of our defense against</p>
<p t="7520" d="2480">Russia&#39;s full-scale aggression is coming to an end.</p>
<p t="10000" d="2520">At present, virtually the entire combat-ready part</p>
<p t="12520" d="3280">of the invadersâ€™ army is concentrated on the territory</p>
<p t="15800" d="3400">of our state and in the border areas of Russia.</p>
<p t="19200" d="2800">They drove against Ukraine almost everyone</p>
<p t="22000" d="3960">and almost everything that can fight us.</p>
<p t="25960" d="2920">Therefore, in this confrontation, in this defense,</p>
<p t="28880" d="1880">before the eyes of the whole world,</p>
<p t="30760" d="1960">we are really opposing the army,</p>
<p t="32720" d="4200">which was considered the second or third in power.</p>
<p t="36920" d="3480">And the way our Armed Forces are holding on,</p>
<p t="40400" d="3960">the way our entire nation is boldly defending itself shows</p>
<p t="44360" d="4200">that the Ukrainian army has long deserved to be higher</p>
<p t="48560" d="3080">than the Russian one in global rankings.</p>
<p t="51640" d="4960">If we had access to all the weapons we need,</p>
<p t="56600" d="4280">which our partners have and which are comparable</p>
<p t="60880" d="2320">to the weapons used by the Russian Federation,</p>
<p t="63200" d="2840">we would have already ended this war.</p>
<p t="66040" d="1880">We would have already restored peace</p>
<p t="67920" d="2560">and liberated our territory from the occupiers.</p>
<p t="70480" d="2760">Because the superiority of the Ukrainian military</p>
<p t="73240" d="4080">in tactics and wisdom is quite obvious.</p>
<p t="77320" d="2560">That is why I emphasize the simple truth in literally</p>
<p t="79880" d="2840">every contact with the leaders of the democratic world,</p>
<p t="82720" d="1960">in all negotiations, in all interviews -</p>
<p t="84680" d="5600">it is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask</p>
<p t="90280" d="4920">for what its partners have been storing somewhere for years.</p>
<p t="95200" d="2360">If they have the weapons that Ukraine needs here,</p>
<p t="97560" d="4080">needs now, if they have the ammunition</p>
<p t="101640" d="3000">that we need here and now,</p>
<p t="104640" d="6880">it is their moral duty first of all to help protect freedom.</p>
<p t="111520" d="4400">Help save the lives of thousands of Ukrainians.</p>
<p t="115920" d="3040">If we had received what we are getting now</p>
<p t="118960" d="3640">in the first week of the war, the benefit for Ukraine</p>
<p t="122600" d="3240">and for freedom in Europe would be greater, I am sure.</p>
<p t="125840" d="4120">And if we get what some partners plan</p>
<p t="129960" d="3800">to hand over to Ukraine in the coming weeks right now,</p>
<p t="133760" d="5880">it will save the lives of thousands of people.</p>
<p t="139640" d="3080">I hope that the partners will hear this thesis</p>
<p t="142720" d="3480">and understand that every day matters.</p>
<p t="146200" d="5680">Any delay in helping Ukraine gives the occupiers</p>
<p t="151880" d="2480">an opportunity to kill more Ukrainians.</p>
<p t="154360" d="3520">The intensity of fire by Russian troops</p>
<p t="157880" d="3120">in the Kharkiv direction, in Donbas</p>
<p t="161000" d="3560">and in the Dnipropetrovsk region has increased significantly.</p>
<p t="164560" d="3680">They still consider ordinary housing</p>
<p t="168240" d="3680">infrastructure normal targets for them.</p>
<p t="171920" d="3600">In this war, the Russian army will forever inscribe itself</p>
<p t="175520" d="2560">in world history as perhaps</p>
<p t="178080" d="5480">the most barbaric and inhuman army in the world.</p>
<p t="183560" d="2920">Purposefully killing civilians,</p>
<p t="186480" d="4720">destroying residential neighborhoods, civilian infrastructure,</p>
<p t="191200" d="4120">using all kinds of weapons for this,</p>
<p t="195320" d="3440">including those prohibited by international conventions,</p>
<p t="198760" d="3280">is the signature of the Russian army.</p>
<p t="202040" d="4560">And this is vileness, which will mark the Russian state</p>
<p t="206600" d="3400">as a source of absolute evil for generations.</p>
<p t="210000" d="3600">And when a special tribunal is set up to convict</p>
<p t="213600" d="3560">all those guilty of war crimes,</p>
<p t="217160" d="3840">a Russian passport will mean only one thing in any country:</p>
<p t="221000" d="4760">unequivocal condemnation from all decent people,</p>
<p t="225760" d="4320">unequivocal unwillingness to cooperate.</p>
<p t="230080" d="2440">The situation in Mariupol remains unchanged -</p>
<p t="232520" d="1760">as severe as possible.</p>
<p t="234280" d="2960">The Russian army is blocking any efforts</p>
<p t="237240" d="6320">to organize humanitarian corridors and save our people.</p>
<p t="243560" d="2560">The occupiers are trying to carry out deportation</p>
<p t="246120" d="2200">or even mobilization of the local residents</p>
<p t="248320" d="1640">who have fallen into their hands.</p>
<p t="249960" d="3280">The fate of at least tens of thousands of Mariupol residents</p>
<p t="253240" d="2400">who were previously relocated</p>
<p t="255640" d="3480">to Russian-controlled territory is unknown.</p>
<p t="259120" d="2640">Unfortunately, we do not hear a response</p>
<p t="261760" d="2400">from Russia to the exchange offer,</p>
<p t="264160" d="5440">which could save the civilians and defenders of Mariupol.</p>
<p t="269600" d="2960">And this silence should be noted by all</p>
<p t="272560" d="3880">who have been or may be associated with Russia.</p>
<p t="276440" d="5120">When your fate is decided, Moscow will be silent.</p>
<p t="281560" d="1000">This is illustrative.</p>
<p t="282560" d="3320">And this is the best argument not to have contacts</p>
<p t="285880" d="1920">with the Russian Federation.</p>
<p t="287800" d="2040">In the south of our country,</p>
<p t="289840" d="4080">the occupiers are trying to demonstrate at least something</p>
<p t="293920" d="1760">that can be presented in Russia</p>
<p t="295680" d="2560">as the alleged readiness of Ukrainians</p>
<p t="298240" d="2760">to cooperate with Russian structures.</p>
<p t="301000" d="2560">It looks pathetic.</p>
<p t="303560" d="3240">After 55 days of war, the occupiers didn&#39;t manage</p>
<p t="306800" d="6240">to attract anyone to their side except for some outcasts.</p>
<p t="313040" d="1640">The situation is quite clear -</p>
<p t="314680" d="2440">Ukrainians in all regions of our state</p>
<p t="317120" d="3480">support Ukrainian national unity.</p>
<p t="320600" d="3000">They support our national statehood.</p>
<p t="323600" d="2080">And I am grateful to all the residents</p>
<p t="325680" d="1840">of the temporarily occupied cities,</p>
<p t="327520" d="4200">temporarily occupied communities - Kherson, Kakhovka, Melitopol</p>
<p t="331720" d="7680">and all our other communities - for this clear position.</p>
<p t="339400" d="2360">No cooperation with the occupiers.</p>
<p t="341760" d="2240">No support for the collaborators.</p>
<p t="344000" d="5640">The more principled we are, the more principled you will be,</p>
<p t="349640" d="3800">the sooner normal life will return.</p>
<p t="353440" d="3000">I held a meeting with representatives of the Verkhovna Rada today.</p>
<p t="356440" d="1880">We discussed the plan of parliamentary work,</p>
<p t="358320" d="4320">agreed on important draft decisions for the state,</p>
<p t="362640" d="2480">which need to be adopted in the near future.</p>
<p t="365120" d="3120">In particular, the deputies were offered</p>
<p t="368240" d="3880">to support the technical decision to extend the martial law.</p>
<p t="372120" d="2120">This is necessary for the legal support</p>
<p t="374240" d="1520">of the defense of our state</p>
<p t="375760" d="2320">and the stable operation of all structures.</p>
<p t="378080" d="2440">We also discussed a bill on the procedure</p>
<p t="380520" d="2480">for deploying the capacities of the enterprises</p>
<p t="383000" d="3520">that were evacuated from the combat zone.</p>
<p t="386520" d="4080">A bill with amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine,</p>
<p t="390600" d="2080">which are necessary for cooperation</p>
<p t="392680" d="2680">with the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p t="395360" d="2280">A bill on the legal regime</p>
<p t="397640" d="3240">in the temporarily occupied territories.</p>
<p t="400880" d="1960">The conversation was substantive,</p>
<p t="402840" d="1720">and I hope that the deputies</p>
<p t="404560" d="3400">will work out these bills soon enough.</p>
<p t="407960" d="5120">I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte.</p>
<p t="413080" d="2920">Informed him about the current situation</p>
<p t="416000" d="4160">in the areas of hostilities and especially in Donbas.</p>
<p t="420160" d="3720">Expressed gratitude for the strong support for Ukraine.</p>
<p t="423880" d="2520">We coordinated the next steps needed</p>
<p t="426400" d="3760">to protect our state and freedom in Europe.</p>
<p t="430160" d="3720">Agreed to increase the supply of heavy weapons,</p>
<p t="433880" d="1920">including armored vehicles.</p>
<p t="435800" d="1960">I also spoke with European Commission</p>
<p t="437760" d="2320">President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>
<p t="440080" d="1680">In particular, on the defensive,</p>
<p t="441760" d="2360">financial and humanitarian needs of Ukraine.</p>
<p t="444120" d="2240">We are accelerating procedures so that Ukraine</p>
<p t="446360" d="3880">can move forward in European integration as fast as possible.</p>
<p t="450240" d="2640">Now, during the war, this movement</p>
<p t="452880" d="4240">and its speed are also elements of protection of our state,</p>
<p t="457120" d="3880">preservation of freedom for our people.</p>
<p t="461000" d="2560">More and more global companies</p>
<p t="463560" d="2520">are announcing the shutdown in Russia.</p>
<p t="466080" d="2200">Today, the German company Henkel</p>
<p t="468280" d="4600">has joined hundreds of other such large companies.</p>
<p t="472880" d="2720">I want to emphasize that this is inevitable:</p>
<p t="475600" d="2760">any normal business will have to make such</p>
<p t="478360" d="3640">a decision and leave Russia.</p>
<p t="482000" d="2480">Now the Russian state is at a level</p>
<p t="484480" d="3280">where any association with it and any support</p>
<p t="487760" d="4200">for it means complicity in mass killings.</p>
<p t="491960" d="3280">Complicity in what will be called crimes</p>
<p t="495240" d="3080">against humanity and genocide.</p>
<p t="498320" d="2120">Before delivering this address,</p>
<p t="500440" d="5600">I signed the traditional decree on awarding our defenders.</p>
<p t="506040" d="2520">286 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine</p>
<p t="508560" d="2560">were awarded state awards.</p>
<p t="511120" d="3320">229 of them are servicemen</p>
<p t="514440" d="3000">of the 36th separate brigade of marines,</p>
<p t="517440" d="4880">which together with other units heroically defends Mariupol.</p>
<p t="522320" d="3480">Maximum gratitude from all the Ukrainian people</p>
<p t="525800" d="2960">to the 36th brigade, Azov,</p>
<p t="528760" d="2880">the 12th brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine,</p>
<p t="531640" d="2880">border guards, Right Sector volunteers,</p>
<p t="534520" d="3600">the 555th military hospital,</p>
<p t="538120" d="2280">police officers and territorial defense.</p>
<p t="540400" d="3840">Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for Mariupol,</p>
<p t="544240" d="4200">our entire state and the people of Ukraine!</p>
<p t="548440" d="3640">Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine!</p>
<p t="552080" d="2600">Glory to Ukraine!</p>
