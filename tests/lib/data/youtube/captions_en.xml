<p t="3770" d="5220">Every human used to have to hunt or gather to survive. But humans are smart...ly lazy so</p>
<p t="8990" d="4690">we made tools to make our work easier. From sticks, to plows, to tractors we’ve gone</p>
<p t="13680" d="4460">from everyone needing to make food to, modern agriculture with almost no one needing to</p>
<p t="18140" d="2220">make food — and yet, we still have abundance.</p>
<p t="20400" d="3680">Of course, it’s not just farming, it’s
everything. We’ve spent the last several</p>
<p t="24080" d="5500">thousand years building tools to reduce physical
labor of all kinds. These are mechanical muscles.</p>
<p t="29580" d="4560">Stronger, more reliable, and more tireless
than human muscles ever could be.</p>
<p t="34140" d="4520">And that&#39;s a good thing. Replacing human labor
with mechanical muscles frees people to specialize</p>
<p t="38660" d="5710">and that leaves everyone better off - even those
still doing physical labor. This is how economies</p>
<p t="44370" d="2240">grow and standards of living rise.</p>
<p t="46610" d="4620">Some people have specialized to be programmers
and engineers whose job is to build mechanical</p>
<p t="51230" d="4890">minds. Just as mechanical muscles made human
labor less in demand so are mechanical minds</p>
<p t="56120" d="2980">making human brain labor less in demand.</p>
<p t="59100" d="4709">This is an economic revolution. You may think
we&#39;ve been here before, but we haven&#39;t.</p>
<p t="63809" d="1690">This time is different.</p>
<p t="65500" d="1630">## Physical Labor</p>
<p t="67130" d="4489">When you think of automation, you probably
think of this: giant, custom-built, expensive,</p>
<p t="71620" d="4830">efficient, but really dumb robots blind to
the world and their own work. They were a</p>
<p t="76450" d="4000">scary kind of automation but they haven&#39;t
taken over the world because they&#39;re only</p>
<p t="80450" d="2860">cost effective in narrow situations.</p>
<p t="83310" d="3969">But they&#39;re the old kind of automation, this
is the new kind.</p>
<p t="87289" d="1030">Meet Baxter.</p>
<p t="88320" d="3880">Unlike these things which require skilled
operators and technicians and millions of dollars,</p>
<p t="92200" d="4839">Baxter has vision and can learn what
you want him to do by watching you do it.</p>
<p t="97039" d="4540">And he costs less than the average annual
salary of a human worker. Unlike his older</p>
<p t="101579" d="5070">brothers he isn&#39;t pre-programmed for one specific
job, he can do whatever work is within the</p>
<p t="106649" d="4750">reach of his arms. Baxter is what might be
thought of as a general purpose robot and</p>
<p t="111399" d="2180">general purpose is a big deal.</p>
<p t="113579" d="5270">Think computers, they too started out as highly
custom and highly expensive, but when cheap-ish</p>
<p t="118849" d="3900">general-purpose computers appeared they quickly
became vital to everything.</p>
<p t="122749" d="4680">A general-purpose computer can just as easily
calculate change or assign seats on an airplane</p>
<p t="127429" d="5751">or play a game or do anything just by swapping
its software. And this huge demand for computers</p>
<p t="133180" d="4990">of all kinds is what makes them both more
powerful and cheaper every year.</p>
<p t="138170" d="5150">Baxter today is the computer of the 1980s.
He’s not the apex but the beginning. Even</p>
<p t="143320" d="4640">if Baxter is slow his hourly cost is pennies
worth of electricity while his meat-based</p>
<p t="147960" d="4810">competition costs minimum wage. A tenth the
speed is still cost effective when it&#39;s a</p>
<p t="152900" d="3710">hundredth the price. And while Baxter isn&#39;t
as smart as some of the other things we will</p>
<p t="156610" d="3990">talk about, he&#39;s smart enough to take over
many low-skill jobs.</p>
<p t="160600" d="4690">And we&#39;ve already seen how dumber robots than
Baxter can replace jobs. In new supermarkets</p>
<p t="165290" d="5250">what used to be 30 humans is now one human
overseeing 30 cashier robots.</p>
<p t="170540" d="4280">Or take the hundreds of thousand baristas employed
world-wide? There’s a barista robot coming</p>
<p t="174820" d="5140">for them. Sure maybe your guy makes the double-mocha-whatever
just perfect and you’d never trust anyone</p>
<p t="179960" d="5300">else -- but millions of people don’t care
and just want a decent cup of coffee. Oh, and</p>
<p t="185260" d="4040">by the way this robot is actually a giant
network of robots that remembers who you are</p>
<p t="189300" d="3740">and how you like your coffee no matter where
you are. Pretty convenient.</p>
<p t="193040" d="4610">We think of technological change as the fancy
new expensive stuff, but the real change comes</p>
<p t="197650" d="4710">from last decade&#39;s stuff getting cheaper and
faster. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening to robots</p>
<p t="202360" d="4870">now. And because their mechanical minds are
capable of decision making they are out-competing</p>
<p t="207230" d="4500">humans for jobs in a way no pure mechanical
muscle ever could.</p>
<p t="211730" d="1940">## Luddite Horses</p>
<p t="213670" d="4510">Imagine a pair of horses in the early 1900s
talking about technology. One worries all</p>
<p t="218180" d="2990">these new mechanical muscles will make horses
unnecessary.</p>
<p t="221170" d="4250">The other reminds him that everything so far
has made their lives easier -- remember all</p>
<p t="225420" d="4790">that farm work? Remember running from coast-to-coast
delivering mail? Remember riding into battle?</p>
<p t="230210" d="4720">All terrible. These city jobs are pretty cushy, and with so many humans in the cities there</p>
<p t="234930" d="2470">will be more jobs for horses than ever.</p>
<p t="237400" d="2800">Even if this car thingy takes off - he might say - there will be</p>
<p t="240200" d="2460">new jobs for horses we can&#39;t imagine.</p>
<p t="242680" d="5560">But you, dear viewer, from beyond 2000 know
what happened -- there are still working horses,</p>
<p t="248240" d="5410">but nothing like before. The horse population
peaked in 1915 -- from that point on it was</p>
<p t="253650" d="1000">nothing but down.</p>
<p t="254650" d="4250">There isn’t a rule of economics that says
better technology makes more better jobs</p>
<p t="258900" d="5699">for horses. It sounds shockingly dumb to even
say that out loud, but swap horses for humans</p>
<p t="264599" d="2790">and suddenly people think it sounds about
right.</p>
<p t="267389" d="4071">As mechanical muscles pushed horses out of
the economy, mechanical minds will do the</p>
<p t="271460" d="5639">same to humans. Not immediately, not everywhere,
but in large enough numbers and soon enough</p>
<p t="277099" d="5000">that it&#39;s going to be a huge problem if we
are not prepared. And we are not prepared.</p>
<p t="282099" d="4000">You, like the second horse, may look at the
state of technology now and think it can’t</p>
<p t="286099" d="4211">possibly replace your job. But technology
gets better, cheaper, and faster at a rate</p>
<p t="290310" d="1780">biology can’t match.</p>
<p t="292090" d="4430">Just as the car was the beginning of the end
for the horse so now does the car show us</p>
<p t="296520" d="1190">the shape of things to come.</p>
<p t="297710" d="4289">## Automobiles</p>
<p t="301999" d="4000">Self-driving cars aren&#39;t the future: they&#39;re
here and they work. Self-driving cars have</p>
<p t="305999" d="3420">travelled hundreds of thousands of miles up
and down the California coast and through</p>
<p t="309419" d="2780">cities -- all without human intervention.</p>
<p t="312199" d="4671">The question is not if they&#39;ll replaces cars,
but how quickly. They don’t need to be perfect,</p>
<p t="316870" d="5710">they just need to be better than us. Humans
drivers, by the way, kill 40,000 people a</p>
<p t="322580" d="4399">year with cars just in the United States.
Given that self-driving cars don’t blink,</p>
<p t="326979" d="3981">don’t text while driving, don’t get sleepy
or stupid, it&#39;s easy to see them being better</p>
<p t="330960" d="2819">than humans because they already are.</p>
<p t="333779" d="5371">Now to describe self-driving cars as cars
at all is like calling the first cars mechanical</p>
<p t="339150" d="4940">horses. Cars in all their forms are so much
more than horses that using the name limits</p>
<p t="344090" d="4620">your thinking about what they can even do.
Lets call self-driving cars what they really</p>
<p t="348710" d="579">are:</p>
<p t="349289" d="5840">Autos: the solution to the transport-objects-from-point-A-to-point-B
problem. Traditional cars happen to be human</p>
<p t="355129" d="4540">sized to transport humans but tiny autos can
work in warehouses and gigantic autos can</p>
<p t="359669" d="4870">work in pit mines. Moving stuff around is
who knows how many jobs but the transportation</p>
<p t="364539" d="4780">industry in the United States employs about
three million people. Extrapolating world-wide</p>
<p t="369319" d="4150">that’s something like 70 million jobs at
a minimum.</p>
<p t="373469" d="1801">These jobs are over.</p>
<p t="375270" d="4100">The usual argument is that unions will prevent
it. But history is filled with workers who</p>
<p t="379370" d="5500">fought technology that would replace them
and the workers always lose. Economics always</p>
<p t="384870" d="5519">wins and there are huge incentives across
wildly diverse industries to adopt autos.</p>
<p t="390389" d="4360">For many transportation companies, humans
are about a third their total costs. That&#39;s</p>
<p t="394749" d="4690">just the straight salary costs. Humans sleeping
in their long haul trucks costs time and money.</p>
<p t="399439" d="4630">Accidents cost money. Carelessness costs money.
If you think insurance companies will be against</p>
<p t="404069" d="4620">it, guess what? Their perfect driver is one
who pays their small premiums and never gets</p>
<p t="408689" d="1410">into an accident.</p>
<p t="410099" d="4011">The autos are coming and they&#39;re the first
place where most people will really see the</p>
<p t="414110" d="4380">robots changing society. But there are many
other places in the economy where the same</p>
<p t="418490" d="2370">thing is happening, just less visibly.</p>
<p t="420860" d="2920">So it goes with autos, so it goes for everything.</p>
<p t="423940" d="2460">## The Shape of Things to Come</p>
<p t="426580" d="4160">It&#39;s easy to look at Autos and Baxters and
think: technology has always gotten rid of</p>
<p t="430740" d="4660">low-skill jobs we don&#39;t want people doing
anyway. They&#39;ll get more skilled and do better</p>
<p t="435400" d="2500">educated jobs -- like they&#39;ve always done.</p>
<p t="437900" d="4680">Even ignoring the problem of pushing a hundred-million
additional people through higher education,</p>
<p t="442580" d="4429">white-collar work is no safe haven either.
If your job is sitting in front of a screen</p>
<p t="447009" d="4101">and typing and clicking -- like maybe you&#39;re
supposed to be doing right now -- the bots</p>
<p t="451110" d="1429">are coming for you too, buddy.</p>
<p t="452539" d="5060">Software bots are both intangible and way
faster and cheaper than physical robots. Given</p>
<p t="457599" d="4361">that white collar workers are, from a company&#39;s
perspective, both more expensive and more</p>
<p t="461960" d="4169">numerous -- the incentive to automate their
work is greater than low skilled work.</p>
<p t="466129" d="4880">And that&#39;s just what automation engineers
are for. These are skilled programmers whose</p>
<p t="471009" d="3750">entire job is to replace your job with a software
bot.</p>
<p t="474759" d="4180">You may think even the world&#39;s smartest automation
engineer could never make a bot to do your</p>
<p t="478939" d="4730">job -- and you may be right -- but the cutting
edge of programming isn&#39;t super-smart programmers</p>
<p t="483669" d="4920">writing bots, it&#39;s super-smart programmers
writing bots that teach themselves how to</p>
<p t="488589" d="3160">do things the programmer could never teach
them to do.</p>
<p t="491749" d="3780">How that works is well beyond the scope of
this video, but the bottom line is there are</p>
<p t="495529" d="4720">limited ways to show a bot a bunch of stuff
to do, show the bot a bunch of correctly done</p>
<p t="500249" d="3720">stuff, and it can figure out how to do the
job to be done.</p>
<p t="503969" d="4130">Even with just a goal and no knowledge of how
to do it the bots can still learn. Take the</p>
<p t="508099" d="5581">stock market which, in many ways, is no longer
a human endeavor. It&#39;s mostly bots that taught</p>
<p t="513680" d="4480">themselves to trade stocks, trading stocks
with other bots that taught themselves.</p>
<p t="518160" d="3879">As a result, the floor of the New York Stock
exchange isn&#39;t filled with traders doing their</p>
<p t="522039" d="2741">day jobs anymore, it&#39;s largely a TV set.</p>
<p t="524780" d="4190">So bots have learned the market and bots have
learned to write. If you&#39;ve picked up a newspaper</p>
<p t="528970" d="4270">lately you&#39;ve probably already read a story
written by a bot. There are companies that</p>
<p t="533240" d="4700">teach bots to write anything: sports
stories, TPS reports, even say, those quarterly</p>
<p t="537940" d="1790">reports that you write at work.</p>
<p t="539730" d="3950">Paper work, decision making, writing -- a
lot of human work falls into that category</p>
<p t="543680" d="5830">and the demand for human metal labor is these
areas is on the way down. But surely the professions</p>
<p t="549510" d="2420">are safe from bots? Yes?</p>
<p t="552000" d="3240">## Professional Bots</p>
<p t="555540" d="4340">When you think &#39;lawyer&#39; it&#39;s easy to think
of trials. But the bulk of lawyering is actually</p>
<p t="559890" d="4490">drafting legal documents, predicting the likely
outcome and impact of lawsuits, and something</p>
<p t="564380" d="4350">called &#39;discovery&#39; which is where boxes of
paperwork gets dumped on the lawyers and they</p>
<p t="568730" d="3880">need to find the pattern or the one out-of-place
transaction among it all.</p>
<p t="572610" d="6090">This can be bot work. Discovery, in particular,
is already not a human job in many law firms.</p>
<p t="578700" d="3720">Not because there isn&#39;t paperwork to go through,
there&#39;s more of it than ever, but because</p>
<p t="582420" d="4300">clever research bots shift through millions
of emails and memos and accounts in hours</p>
<p t="586720" d="5030">not weeks -- crushing human researchers in
terms of not just cost and time but, most</p>
<p t="591750" d="5060">importantly, accuracy. Bots don&#39;t get sleepy
reading through a million emails.</p>
<p t="596810" d="4530">But that&#39;s the simple stuff: IBM has a bot
named Watson: you may have seen him on TV</p>
<p t="601340" d="4250">destroy humans at Jeopardy — but that was
just a fun side project for him.</p>
<p t="605590" d="4220">Watson&#39;s day-job is to be the best doctor
in the world: to understand what people say</p>
<p t="609810" d="4440">in their own words and give back accurate
diagnoses. And he&#39;s already doing that at</p>
<p t="614250" d="3460">Slone-Kettering, giving guidance on lung cancer
treatments.</p>
<p t="617710" d="3990">Just as Auto don’t need to be perfect -- they
just need to make fewer mistakes than humans --</p>
<p t="621700" d="2230">the same goes for doctor bots.</p>
<p t="623930" d="4170">Human doctors are by no means perfect -- the
frequency and severity of misdiagnoses are</p>
<p t="628100" d="5140">terrifying -- and human doctors are severely
limited in dealing with a human&#39;s complicated</p>
<p t="633240" d="4700">medical history. Understanding every drug
and every drug&#39;s interaction with every other</p>
<p t="637940" d="3000">drug is beyond the scope of human knowability.</p>
<p t="640940" d="4510">Especially when there are research robots
whose whole job it is to test thousands of new</p>
<p t="645450" d="1580">drugs at a time.</p>
<p t="647030" d="4170">And human doctors can only improve through their
own experiences. Doctor bots can learn from</p>
<p t="651200" d="3730">the experiences of every doctor bot. Can read
the latest in medical research and keep track</p>
<p t="654930" d="4260">of everything that happens to all their patients
world-wide and make correlations that would</p>
<p t="659190" d="2570">be impossible to find otherwise.</p>
<p t="661760" d="4590">Not all doctors will go away, but when the doctor
bots are comparable to humans and they&#39;re</p>
<p t="666350" d="4500">only as far away as your phone -- the need
for general doctors will be less.</p>
<p t="670850" d="4500">So professionals, white-collar workers and
low-skill workers all have things to worry about</p>
<p t="675350" d="5910">from automation. But perhaps you are unfazed because
you&#39;re a special creative snowflake. Well</p>
<p t="681260" d="2140">guess what? You&#39;re not that special.</p>
<p t="683620" d="3100">## Creative Bots</p>
<p t="687680" d="5000">Creativity may feel like magic, but it isn&#39;t.
The brain is a complicated machine -- perhaps</p>
<p t="692680" d="4240">the most complicated machine in the whole
universe -- but that hasn&#39;t stopped us from</p>
<p t="696930" d="1290">trying to simulate it.</p>
<p t="698220" d="3830">There is this notion that just as mechanical
muscles allowed us to move into thinking jobs</p>
<p t="702050" d="3460">that mechanical minds will allow us  to
move into creative work.</p>
<p t="705510" d="4940">But even if we assume  the human mind is magically creative -- it&#39;s
not, but just for the sake of argument --</p>
<p t="710450" d="5490">artistic creativity isn&#39;t what the majority of jobs
depend on. The number of writers and poets</p>
<p t="715940" d="4690">and directors and actors and artists who actually
make a living doing their work is a tiny,</p>
<p t="720630" d="3910">tiny portion of the labor force. And given
that these are professions dependent</p>
<p t="724550" d="4060">on popularity they&#39;ll always be a very small
portion of the population.</p>
<p t="728610" d="4190">There can&#39;t be such a thing as a poem and painting
based economy.</p>
<p t="732800" d="4470">Oh, by the way, this music in the background
that you&#39;re listening to? It was written by a bot.</p>
<p t="737270" d="4520">Her name is Emily Howell and she can
write an infinite amount of new music all day for free.</p>
<p t="741790" d="3260">And people can&#39;t tell the difference between her and human composers</p>
<p t="745050" d="1950">when put to a blind test.</p>
<p t="747000" d="4080">Talking about artificial creativity gets weird
fast -- what does that even mean?</p>
<p t="751080" d="2720">But it&#39;s nonetheless a developing field.</p>
<p t="753800" d="3590">People used to think that playing chess was
a uniquely creative human skill that machines</p>
<p t="757390" d="5680">could never do right up until they beat the
best of us. And so it will go for all human talents.</p>
<p t="763520" d="2600">## Conclusion</p>
<p t="767220" d="4000">Right: this may have been a lot to take
in, and you might want to reject it -- it&#39;s</p>
<p t="771220" d="4390">easy to be cynical of the endless and idiotic
predictions of futures that never are. So</p>
<p t="775610" d="4580">that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to emphasize again that
this stuff isn&#39;t science fiction. The robots</p>
<p t="780200" d="5330">are here right now. There is a terrifying
amount of working automation in labs and warehouses</p>
<p t="785530" d="1940">around the world.</p>
<p t="787470" d="5480">We have been through economic revolutions
before, but the robot revolution is different.</p>
<p t="792950" d="5040">Horses aren&#39;t unemployed now because they
got lazy as a species, they’re unemployable.</p>
<p t="797990" d="3450">There&#39;s little work a horse can do that do
to pay for its housing and hay.</p>
<p t="801440" d="5180">And many bright, perfectly capable humans
will find themselves the new horse: unemployable</p>
<p t="806620" d="1600">through no fault of their own.</p>
<p t="808220" d="4790">But if you still think new jobs will save
us: here is one final point to consider. The</p>
<p t="813010" d="5610">US census in 1776 tracked only a few kinds
of jobs. Now there are hundreds of kinds of</p>
<p t="818620" d="4250">jobs, but the new ones are not a significant
part of the labor force.</p>
<p t="822870" d="4010">Here&#39;s the list of jobs ranked by the number
of people who perform them - it&#39;s a sobering</p>
<p t="826880" d="5490">list with the transportation industry at the
top. Continuing downward, all of this work existed</p>
<p t="832370" d="6080">in some form a hundred years ago and almost
all of them are targets for automation. Only</p>
<p t="838450" d="4210">when we get to number 33 on the list is there
finally something new.</p>
<p t="842660" d="4680">Don&#39;t that every barista or white collar worker need lose their job before things are a problem.</p>
<p t="847340" d="2670">The unemployment rate during the great depression
was 25%.</p>
<p t="850010" d="7350">This list above is 45% of the workforce. Just
what we&#39;ve talked about today, the stuff that</p>
<p t="857360" d="5160">already works, can push us over that number
pretty soon. And given that even in our modern</p>
<p t="862520" d="5690">technological wonderland new kinds of work
aren&#39;t a significant portion of the economy,</p>
<p t="868210" d="1780">this is a big problem.</p>
<p t="869990" d="4880">This video isn&#39;t about how automation is bad
-- rather that automation is inevitable. It&#39;s</p>
<p t="874870" d="5090">a tool to produce abundance for little effort.
We need to start thinking now about what to</p>
<p t="879960" d="4560">do when large sections of the population are
unemployable -- through no fault of their own.</p>
<p t="884520" d="4700">What to do in a future where, for most
jobs, humans need not apply.</p>
