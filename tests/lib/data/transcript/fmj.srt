1
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,160
"America has heard the bugle call

2
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,530
"And you know it involves us one and all

3
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,830
"I don't suppose that war will ever end

4
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,720
"There's fighting
that will break us up again

5
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,570
"Good-bye, my darling
Hello, Vietnam

6
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,820
"I'm here to take a battle to be won

7
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,260
"Kiss me good-bye
And write me while I'm gone

8
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,550
"Good-bye, my sweetheart
Hello, Vietnam "

9
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,220
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

10
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,430
You will speak only when spoken to.

11
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,360
The first and last words
out of your sewers will be "Sir! "

12
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,280
Do you maggots understand?

13
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,910
Sir, yes, sir!

14
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,320
I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

15
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,080
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

16
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,800
...you will be a weapon,
a minister of death, praying for war.

17
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,810
But until that day, you are pukes!

18
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,470
The lowest form of life on Earth.

19
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,930
You are not even human fucking beings!

20
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,610
You are only unorganized,
grab-asstic pieces of amphibian shit!

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,950
Because I am hard, you won't like me.

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,780
The more you hate me,
the more you'll learn.

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,160
I am hard, but I am fair!

24
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,490
There is no racial bigotry here!

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,600
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,140
Here, you are all equally worthless!

27
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,150
My orders are to weed out non-hackers...

28
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,410
...who do not pack the gear
to be in my beloved Corps!

29
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,670
Do you maggots understand that?

30
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,040
Bullshit! I can't hear you!

31
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,800
-What's your name, scumbag?
-Sir, Private Brown, sir!

32
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,560
From now on you're Private Snowball!
Like that name?

33
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,890
Sir, yes, sir!

34
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,480
There's one thing you won't like!

35
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,950
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

36
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,730
...in my mess hall!

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,020
Is that you, John Wayne?

38
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,290
Is this me?

39
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,900
Who said that?

40
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,320
Who the fuck said that?

41
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,200
Who's the slimy communist cocksucker
down here...

42
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,790
...who just signed his own death warrant?

43
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,710
Nobody, huh?

44
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,960
The fairy fucking godmother said it!

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,010
Out-fucking-standing!
I will P.T. you all until you die!

46
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,070
I will P.T. you until your assholes
suck buttermilk!

47
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,940
Was it you, you little fuck?

48
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,410
You look like a fucking worm !
I bet it was you!

49
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,920
Sir, I said it, sir!

50
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,030
Well, no shit.

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,780
What are you, a fucking comedian?
Private Joker.

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,740
I admire your honesty.

53
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,500
I like you. Come over to my house
and fuck my sister!

54
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,260
You little scumbag! I've got your name!
I've got your ass!

55
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,610
You will not laugh or cry!

56
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,270
You will learn by the number!

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,180
Get up! Get on your feet!

58
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,610
Unfuck yourself or I'll unscrew
your head and shit down your neck!

59
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,450
-Why did you join my beloved Corps?
-Sir, to kill, sir!

60
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,920
You're a killer!

61
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,210
Let me see your war face!

62
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,550
You've got a war face?

63
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,810
That's a war face! Let me see yours!

64
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,530
You didn't convince me!
Let me see your real war face!

65
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,490
You don't scare me! Work on it!

66
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,650
What's your excuse?

67
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,160
Sir, excuse, sir?

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm asking the fucking questions,
understand?

69
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,030
Thank you!
Can I be in charge for a while?

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,000
Are you shook up? Nervous?

71
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,340
Sir, I am, sir!

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Do I make you nervous?

73
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,000
Were you about to call me an asshole?

74
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,350
-How tall are you, Private?
-Sir, 5'9", sir!

75
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,520
I didn't know they stacked shit that high!

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,220
Trying to squeeze an inch in on me, huh?

77
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,810
The best part of you ran down
the crack of your mama's ass...

78
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,690
...and ended up as a brown stain
on the mattress!

79
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,820
Where in hell are you from?

80
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,660
Holy dogshit! Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy!

81
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,220
You don't look like a steer,
so that narrows it down!

82
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,800
Suck dicks?

83
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,180
You a peter-puffer?

84
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,680
I bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

85
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,130
...and not have the courtesy
to give him a reach-around!

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,230
I'll be watching you!

87
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,640
Your parents have children that lived?

88
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,780
Bet they regret that!

89
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,660
You're so ugly
you're a modern-art masterpiece!

90
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,550
-What's your name, fatbody?
-Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!

91
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,510
Lawrence, what, of Arabia?

92
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,340
That name sounds like royalty!
You royalty?

93
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,590
You suck dicks?

94
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,640
Bet you could suck a golf ball
through a garden hose!

95
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,430
I don't like that name!
Faggots and sailors are called Lawrence!

96
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,650
From now on you're Gomer Pyle!

97
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,180
Think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
Think I'm funny?

98
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,400
Then wipe off that disgusting grin!

99
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,690
Any fucking time, sweetheart!

100
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,300
I'm trying, sir!

101
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,630
I'll give you three seconds...

102
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,970
...exactly three fucking seconds...

103
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,470
...to wipe off that stupid grin...

104
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,630
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you!

105
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,300
-Sir, I can't help it, sir!
-Get on your knees, scumbag!

106
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,220
Now choke yourself!

107
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,390
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts!

108
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,730
Don't pull my hand over there!

109
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,280
I said choke yourself!
Lean forward and choke yourself!

110
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,160
Are you through grinning?

111
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,290
Bullshit! I can't hear you!

112
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,250
Bullshit! I still can't hear you!
Sound off like you got a pair!

113
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,140
That's enough. Get on your feet!

114
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,930
Pyle, square your ass away and
start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

115
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,530
...or I will definitely fuck you up!

116
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,260
Parris Island, South Carolina...

117
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,400
...the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

118
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,540
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

119
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,540
"Mama and Papa were laying in bed!

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,550
"Mama rolled over
and this is what she said:

121
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,840
"'Oh, give me some...

122
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,810
"'...P.T.!'

123
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,490
"Good for you and good for me!

124
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,660
"Mmm, good!

125
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,570
"Up in the morning to the rising sun!

126
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,820
"Gotta run all day...

127
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,700
"...till the running's done!

"Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch!

129

"Got the blueballs, crabs
and the seven-year itch!"

130
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,420
Left shoulder, hut!

131
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,840
What are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,080
Sir, I don't know, sir!

133
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:05,080
Do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

134
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,890
You did that on purpose!
You want to be different!

135
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,600
-What side was that?
-Sir, left side, sir!

136
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Are you sure, Private Pyle?

137
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,280
What side was that?

138
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,910
Sir, right side, sir!

139
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,490
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle!

140
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,460
Pick up your fucking cover!

141
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,130
Tonight, you pukes will sleep
with your rifles!

142
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,020
You will give your rifle a girl's name!

143
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,150
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get!

144
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,240
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

145
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,870
...through her pretty
pink panties are over!

146
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,040
You're married to this piece...

147
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,450
...this weapon of iron and wood!

148
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,320
And you will be faithful!

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,580
Prepare to mount!

150
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,810
Pray!

151
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,220
"This is my rifle.

152
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,770
"There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

153

"My rifle is my best friend.

"I must fire my rifle true.

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,810
"I must shoot him before he shoots me.

161
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,060
"I will.

162
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,310
"Before God I swear this creed.

163
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,100
"My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

164
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,570
"We are the masters of our enemy.

165
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,110
"We are the saviors of my life.

166
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,700
"So be it...

167
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,620
"...until there is no enemy, but peace.

168
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,950
"Amen."

169
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,820
At ease!

170
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,880
Good night, ladies!

171
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,220
Hit it!

172
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,760
This is not your daddy's shotgun,
Cowboy!

173
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,750
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle!

174
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,050
Four inches from your chest, Pyle!

175
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,380
Four inches!

176
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,340
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!

177
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,810
"This is for fighting!
This is for fun!

178
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,640
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!

179
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,350
"This is for fighting!
This is for fun! "

180
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,760
You're bouncing!

181
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,020
Ten fucking seconds!

182
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,570
It should take you ten seconds
to negotiate this obstacle!

183
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,690
Quickly, move it out!

184
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,380
No swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

185
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,710
...until they get this obstacle down
to less than ten fucking seconds!

186
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,160
Next two! Quickly!

187
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,000
Get over that goddamn obstacle!
Move it!

188
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,210
Private Joker, are you a killer?

189
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,760
Let me hear your war cry!

190
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,050
Get your fat ass over there!

191
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,110
That's right, Private Pyle...

192
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,570
...don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top!

193
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,570
If God wanted you up there,
He'd have miracled your ass up there!

194
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,630
Get your fat ass up there!

195
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,800
What the hell's wrong with you?

196
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,220
If there was some pussy up there,
you could get up there, couldn't you?

197
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,100
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds
of chewed bubble gum, Pyle.

198
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,060
One for the commandant!

199
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,160
One for the Corps!

200
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,710
Get up there!

201
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,960
Pull!

202
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,090
The Corps don't get theirs!
Get up there, Pyle!

203
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,830
Pull!

204
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,620
Pull, Pyle, pull!

205
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,600
One pull-up, Pyle! Come on, pull!

206
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,100
You've got to be shitting me!
Get your ass up there!

207
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,140
Do you mean to tell me you cannot do
one single pull-up?

208
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,250
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle!
Get out of my face!

209
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,450
Get up there, Snowball.

210
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,540
Get up here, fatboy!

211
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,590
Quickly! Move it up, Pyle! Move it up!

212
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,340
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

213
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,340
Get up here! You're too slow! Move it!

214
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,690
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down!

215
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,940
That would break my fucking heart!

216
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,600
Quickly! Up and over! Up and over!

217
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,110
What in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

218
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,700
Get up and over!

219
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,570
Move it, move it!

220
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,200
Are you quitting on me?

221
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,490
Well, are you?

222
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,120
Then quit, you slimy, fucking,
walrus-looking piece of shit!

223
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,010
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!

224
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,710
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!

225
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,170
Now! Move it!

226
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,730
I'm going to rip your balls off so you
can't contaminate the rest of the world!

227
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,650
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

228
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,990
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo!

229
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,740
Pick 'em up and set 'em down, Pyle!

230
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,020
Quickly! Move it up!

231
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,080
Were you born a fat, slimy scumbag,
you piece of shit, Private Pyle?

232
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,420
Or did you have to work on it?

233
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,880
Move it up!

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,290
Quickly! Hustle up!

235
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,920
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, Private Pyle!

236
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,100
Are you going to fucking die?
Are you going to die on me?

237
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,550
Do it now!

238
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,480
Move it up!

239
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,900
Hustle it up! Quickly!

240
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,530
Feel dizzy?

241
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,160
Faint?

242
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,860
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on!

243
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,170
Quickly, ladies! Assholes and elbows!
Move it out!

244
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,790
Get up!

245
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,110
Reveille! Reveille!

246
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,370
Drop your cocks and grab your socks!

247
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,210
Today is Sunday!
Divine worship is 0800.

248
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,960
Get your bunks made
and your uniforms on.

249
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,430
Police call in two minutes.

250
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,260
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

251
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,230
Finish your bunks, then you two turds
clean the head.

252
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,690
I want that head so sanitary...

253
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,650
...that the Virgin Mary could go
in there and take a dump!

254
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,030
Do you believe in the Virgin Mary?

255
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,750
Sir, no, sir!

256
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,880
Private Joker, I don't believe
I heard you correctly!

257
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,580
Sir, the private said "No, sir," sir!

258
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,350
You little maggot!
You make me want to vomit!

259
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,230
You communist heathen, sound off
that you love the Virgin Mary...

260
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,520
...or I'll stomp your guts out!

261
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,260
You love the Virgin Mary, don't you?

262
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,730
Negative, sir!

263
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,530
Are you trying to offend me?

264
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,020
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong!

265
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,030
And that you will beat him harder
if he reverses himself, sir!

266
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,940
Who's your squad leader?

267
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,960
The private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir!

268
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,700
Private Snowball reporting, sir!

269
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,560
You're fired! Private Joker is promoted
to squad leader!

270
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,190
Disappear, scumbag!

271
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,620
Reporting as ordered, sir!

272
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,290
From now on Private Joker is your new
squad leader and you bunk with him.

273
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,650
He'll teach you!

274
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,520
He'll teach you how to pee!

275
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,270
Private Joker is ignorant
but he's got guts, and guts is enough.

276
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,240
Now you ladies carry on.

277
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,500
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

278
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,330
Operating rod handle.

279
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,620
Operating rod guide.

280
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,260
And the left one over the right.

281
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,220
Right one over the left.

282
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,440
Left one over the right.

283
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,920
Right one over the left.

284
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,130
Just throw your other leg over.

285
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,660
Pull the next one over
and you're home free.

286
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,840
Just throw it over.

287
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,020
That'a boy. Just set it down.

288
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,620
Congratulations, Leonard.

289
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,460
You did it.

290
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,280
Fold the blanket and sheet back together.

291
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,750
Make a four-inch fold.

292
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,470
Got it?

293
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,140
You do it.

294
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,650
Right shoulder, hut!

295
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,980
Port, hut!

296
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,460
Order, hut!

297
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,110
Square these weapons away.

298
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,000
The deadliest weapon in the world...

299
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,310
...is a Marine, and his rifle.

300
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,700
It is your killer instinct
that must be harnessed...

301
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,930
...if you expect to survive in combat.

302
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,540
Your rifle...

303
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,250
...is only a tool.

304
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,100
It is a hard heart that kills.

305
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,530
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

306
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,790
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

307
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,170
You will not kill.

308
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,550
You will become dead Marines.

309
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,960
And then you will be in a world of shit.

310
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,850
Because Marines are not allowed...

311
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,850
...to die without permission!

312
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,060
Do you maggots understand?

313
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,020
"I love working for Uncle Sam !

314
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,860
"Lets me know just who I am !

315
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,110
"One, two, three, four!
United States Marine Corps!

316
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,000
"One, two, three, four!
I love the Marine Corps!

317
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,640
"My Corps! Your Corps!

318
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,250
"Our Corps! Marine Corps!

319
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,930
"I don't know, but I've been told...

320
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,800
"...Eskimo pussy is mighty cold!

321
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,360
"Mmm, good! Feels good!

322
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,230
"Is good! Real good!

323
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,130
"Tastes good! Mighty good!

324
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,160
"Good for you! Good for me! "

325
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,550
Trim 'em !

326
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,170
Toe-jam !

327
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,010
Pop that blister!

328
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,790
Jesus H. Christ!

329
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,410
-Why is your footlocker unlocked?
-Sir, I don't know, sir!

330
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,990
If there is one thing
in this world I hate...

331
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,520
...it is an unlocked footlocker!
You know that, right?

332
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,750
Without dickheads like you,
there'd be no thievery in the world!

333
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,760
Get down!

334
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,940
Now let's just see
if there's anything missing!

335
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,910
Holy Jesus!

336
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,340
What is that?

337
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,760
What the fuck is that?

338
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,420
What is that, Private Pyle?

339
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,260
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir!

340
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,100
-Where did you get it?
-From the mess hall, sir!

341
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,770
Is chow allowed in the barracks, Pyle?

342
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,850
Are you allowed to eat
jelly doughnuts, Private?

343
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,110
-Why not, Private?
-Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir!

344
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,240
Because you are a disgusting fatbody,
Private Pyle!

345
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,120
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker?

346
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,150
Because I was hungry, sir!

347
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,250
Because you were hungry?

348
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,300
Private Pyle...

349
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,590
...has dishonored himself
and dishonored the platoon!

350
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,890
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed!

351
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,600
I have failed because
you have not helped me!

352
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,070
You people...

353
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,860
...have not given Private Pyle
the proper motivation!

354
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,510
From now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

355
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,970
...l will not punish him.

356
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,580
I will punish all of you!

357
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,170
And the way I see it, ladies...

358
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:59,070
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut!

359
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,140
Get on your faces!

360
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,940
Open your mouth!

361
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,620
They're paying for it, you eat it!

362
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,410
Ready, exercise!

363
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,330
"One, two, three, four!

364
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,910
"I love the Marine Corps! "

365
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,110
You really look like shit today.

366
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,080
Everybody hates me now.

367
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,640
Even you.

368
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,160
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

369
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,910
You just keep making mistakes,
getting everybody in trouble.

370
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,480
I can't do anything right.

371
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,030
I need help.

372
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,770
I'm trying to help you.

373
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,740
I'm really trying.

374
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,080
Tuck your shirt in.

375
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,640
Do it.

376
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,120
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fatboy.

377
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,710
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

378
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,170
Semper fi, do or die!

379
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,540
Gung ho, gung ho!

380
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,730
What makes the grass grow?

381
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,810
Blood, blood, blood.

382
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,570
What do we do for a living, ladies?

383
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,570
Kill, kill, kill!

384
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,290
I can't hear you!

385
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,170
Kill, kill, kill!

386
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,170
Bullshit! I still can't hear you!

387
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,260
Kill, kill, kill!

388
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,940
Do any of you know
who Charles Whitman was?

389
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,230
None of you dumbasses knows?

390
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,590
Sir, he shot all those people
from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir!

391
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,260
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...

392
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,300
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas...

393
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,650
...from distances of up to 400 yards.

394
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,950
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

395
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,420
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir!

396
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,270
And do you know how far away he was?

397
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,140
Sir, it was far! From that
book suppository building, sir!

398
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,430
Knock it off!

399
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,860
250 feet!

400
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,020
He was 250 feet away and shooting
at a moving target.

401
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,320
He got off three rounds...

402
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,750
...with an Italian bolt-action rifle
in six seconds...

403
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,120
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot!

404
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,250
Do any of you know where...

405
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,630
...these individuals learned to shoot?

406
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,770
Sir, in the Marines, sir!

407
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,760
In the Marines! Outstanding!
Those individuals...

408
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,070
...showed what one motivated Marine
and his rifle can do!

409
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,250
Before you ladies leave my island...

410
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,060
...you will all be able
to do the same thing!

411
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,820
"Happy birthday to you

412
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,130
"Happy birthday, dear Jesus"

413
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Today...

414
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,810
...is Christmas!

415
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,640
There will be a magic show at 0930!

416
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,360
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

417
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,690
...about how the free world
will conquer Communism...

418
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,290
...with the aid of God and a few Marines!

419
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,030
God has a hard-on for Marines...

420
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,760
...because we kill everything we see!

421
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,590
He plays His games...

422
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,000
...we play ours!

423
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,430
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

424
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,590
...we keep heaven packed...

425
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,070
...with fresh souls!

426
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,860
God was here before the Marine Corps!

427
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,080
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

428
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,130
...but your ass belongs to the Corps!

429
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,540
Do you ladies understand?

430
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,720
I can't hear you!

431
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,060
It's been swabbed and brushed.

432
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,390
Everything...

433
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,980
...is clean.

434
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,700
Beautiful.

435
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,110
So that it slides perfectly.

436
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:09,970
Nice.

437
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,900
Everything cleaned...

438
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,400
...oiled.

439
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,460
So that your action is beautiful.

440
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,500
Smooth, Charlene.

441
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,400
Leonard talks to his rifle.

442
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,760
I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore.

443
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,540
I think Leonard's a Section 8.

444
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,380
It don't surprise me.

445
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,020
I want to slip my tubesteak
into your sister.

446
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,610
What will you take in trade?

447
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,740
What do you got?

448
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,960
Outstanding!

449
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,130
We've finally found something you do well!

450
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,610
What is your 6th general order?

451
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,740
Sir, to receive, obey and pass on
to the sentry who relieves me...

452
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,280
...all orders....

453
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,480
Sir, the 6th general....

454
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,150
The private does not know, sir!

455
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,530
You slimy scumbag,
get down and give me 25!

456
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,300
How many counts in that movement?

457
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,670
Sir, four, sir!

458
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,640
Why look down in the chamber?

459
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,940
Sir, to be sure the inspecting officer
is not given a loaded weapon, sir!

460
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,310
What's your 5th general order?

461
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,410
Sir, to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir!

462
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,870
What's this weapon's name?

463
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,870
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir!

464
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,870
Private, you are definitely
born again hard.

465
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,580
I may even let you serve as a rifleman
in my beloved Corps.

466
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,960
"I don't want no teenage queen!

467
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,520
"I just want my M-14!

468
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,150
"If I die in the combat zone

469
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,530
"Box me up and ship me home!

470
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,120
"Pin my medals upon my chest!

471
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,630
"Tell my mom I've done my best! "

472
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,800
Graduation is only a few days away...

473
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:42,490
...and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

474
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,600
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

475
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,400
The instructors are proud to see us
growing beyond their control.

476
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,130
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

477
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,510
The Marine Corps wants killers.

478
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,630
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

479
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,930
Men without fear.

480
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,140
Today...

481
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,470
...you people are no longer maggots.

482
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,850
Today, you are Marines.

483
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,080
You are part of a brotherhood.

484
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,750
From now on, until the day you die...

485
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,250
...wherever you are...

486
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,180
...every Marine is your brother.

487
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,770
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

488
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,120
Some of you will not come back.

489
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,780
But always remember this.:

490
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,840
Marines die.

491
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,210
That's what we're here for!

492
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,580
But the Marine Corps lives forever.

493
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:54,140
And that means you live forever!

494
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,510
0300, Infantry.

495
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,220
0300, Infantry.

496
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,490
1800, Engineers.
You go out and find mines.

497
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,900
Cowboy!

498
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,660
0300, Infantry.

499
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,150
0300, Infantry.

500
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,450
Joker!

501
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,330
4212...

502
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,320
...Basic Military Journalism.

503
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,200
You must be shitting me!

504
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,340
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

505
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,620
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

506
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,250
Sir, I wrote for
my high-school newspaper, sir!

507
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,920
Christ, you're not a writer,
you're a killer!

508
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,310
A killer, yes, sir!

509
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,520
Gomer Pyle!

510
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,810
You forget your fucking name?
0300, Infantry. You made it.

511
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,290
Our last night on the island.

512
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,780
I draw fire watch.

513
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,430
Hi, Joker.

514
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,640
Are those...

515
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,100
...live rounds?

516
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,640
7.62 millimeter.

517
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,240
Full metal jacket.

518
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:58,420
Leonard, if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

519
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,420
...we'll both be in a world of shit.

520
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,720
I am...

521
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,520
...in a world...

522
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,400
...of shit!

523
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,720
Left shoulder, hut!

524
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,490
Right shoulder, hut!

525
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,490
Lock and load.

526
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,320
Order, hut!

527
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,990
"This is my rifle!

528
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,920
"There are many like it,
but this one is mine."

529
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,550
Get back in your bunks!

530
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

531
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,530
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

532
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,850
Why is Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

533
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,980
Why is Pyle holding that weapon?

534
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,540
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

535
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,880
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform you...

536
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,970
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir!

537
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:26,120
Now listen to me, Private Pyle...

538
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,000
...and listen good.

539
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,000
I want that weapon...

540
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,450
...and I want it now!

541
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,290
Place that rifle on the deck
at your feet...

542
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,460
...and step back away from it.

543
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,070
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

544
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,570
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

545
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,210
Easy, Leonard.

546
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,960
Go easy, man.

547
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:59,670
Hey, baby.

548
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,290
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

549
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,740
Not just this minute.

550
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,730
Well, baby, me so horny.

551
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,880
Me so horny.

552
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,540
Me love you long time.

553
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,130
You party?

554
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,760
Yeah, we might party.

555
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,540
-How much?
-$15.

556
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,840
$15 for both of us?

557
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,850
No. Each you $15.

558
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,590
Me love you long time.

559
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,190
Me so horny.

560
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,270
$15 too beaucoup.

561
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,320
$5 each.

562
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,860
Me suckee-suckee.

563
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,190
Me love you too much.

564
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,240
$5 is all my mom allows me to spend.

565
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,150
Okay! $10 each.

566
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,780
What do we get for $10?

567
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,830
Everything you want.

568
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,880
Everything?

569
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,760
Buddy, you feel like spending some
of your hard-earned money?

570
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:06,890
Half of these gook whores are officers
in the Viet Cong.

571
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,380
The other half have TB.

572
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,720
Be sure you only fuck
the ones who cough.

573
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,880
That sucker really had some moves on him.

574
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,080
You know what pisses me off
about these people?

575
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,170
We're helping them
and they shit all over us.

576
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,350
I just can't feature that.

577
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,350
Don't take it too hard.
It's just business.

578
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,820
I hate Da Nang.
I want to go out into the field.

579
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:32,060
I'm here three months and all I do is take
handshake shots at award ceremonies.

580
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,670
You'd get wasted the first day
and it would be my fault.

581
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,080
A high-school girl could do my job.

582
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,080
I want to get into the shit.

583
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,910
I want some trigger time.

584
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:48,310
If you get killed, your mom will find me
and beat the shit out of me.

585
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,780
That's a negative.

586
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,110
Let's keep it short and sweet.
Anybody got anything new?

587
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,120
Rumor has it that the Tet ceasefire
will be cancelled.

588
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,500
Rear echelon paranoia.

589
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,680
Intelligence says Charlie might try
something big during Tet.

590
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:13,390
They say the same thing every year.

591
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,470
There's a lot of talk about it.

592
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,430
Don't lose any sleep over it.

593
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,400
The Tet holiday is like July Fourth,
Christmas and New Year in one.

594
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,360
Every zipperhead in the North and South,
will bang gongs...

595
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,410
...and bark at the moon.

596
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,040
Ann-Margret and entourage
are due next week.

597
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,240
I want someone to stick
with her for a few days.

598
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,950
Rafterman, you take it.

599
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,080
Get some good low-angle stuff.

600
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:44,000
Don't be obvious, but I want to see fur
and early morning dew.

601
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:50,340
"Diplomats in Dungarees. Marine
engineers rebuild Dong Phuc villages...."

602
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,940
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees.

603
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,100
If they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

604
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,070
I'll make a note of it, sir.

605
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,360
"N.V.A. Soldier Deserts
After Reading Pamphlets."

606
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,450
"An N.V.A. regular, who realized
his side would lose...

607
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,130
"...deserted after reading
Open Arms pamphlets."

608
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:12,550
That's good, Dave.
But why say, "N.V.A. regular"?

609
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,370
Is there an irregular?

610
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,350
How about N.V.A. soldier?

611
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,840
I'll fix it.

612
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:23,320
"The Lawrence Welk Show" will be on TV
in two weeks. Dave, do 100 words on it.

613
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,120
"Not While We're Eating."

614
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,910
"N.V.A. learned not to interrupt meals of
Marines on a search-and-destroy mission."

615
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,280
We have a new directive from M.A.F.
on search and destroy.

616
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:40,540
Substitute "sweep and clear"
in place of "search and destroy."

617
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:41,590
Got it?

618
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,510
Got it. Very catchy.

619
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,470
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

620
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:52,510
The kill. The grunts
must have hit something.

621
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,730
Didn't see them.

622
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,440
I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

623
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,570
Grunts who buy toothbrushes
and deodorant for gooks:

624
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,660
"Winning of Hearts And Minds."

625
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,320
And combat action resulting in a kill:
"Winning the War."

626
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,120
You must have seen blood trails,
drag marks?

627
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,570
It was raining, sir.

628
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,630
That's why God passed
the law of probability.

629
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,800
Rewrite it with a happy ending,
say, one kill.

630
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,410
A sapper or an officer. Which?

631
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,290
Whichever you say.

632
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,080
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

633
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,560
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

634
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,190
You'd like our guys to read
the paper and feel bad?

635
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,230
In case you didn't know,
this is not a popular war.

636
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,770
Our job is to report the news that the...

637
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:45,370
..."why-are-we-here"
civilian newsmen ignore.

638
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:48,960
Maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

639
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,050
You could find more blood trails
and drag marks.

640
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:58,010
I've had my ass in the grass.
Can't say I liked it much.

641
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,130
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

642
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,680
My present duties keep me where I belong:

643
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,720
In the rear with the gear.

644
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,720
Tet. The Year of the Monkey.

645
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,960
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

646
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:25,180
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

647
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,540
I am fucking bored to death, man.

648
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,860
I have to get back in the shit.

649
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,060
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

650
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,320
Joker's so tough, he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

651
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,160
...then ask for seconds.

652
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,380
Listen up, pilgrim.

653
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:59,130
A day without blood is like
a day without sunshine!

654
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,020
Joker thinks the bad bush is
between old mama-san's legs.

655
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,520
He's never been in the shit.

656
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,100
Hard to talk about. Like on Hastings.

657
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:14,200
You weren't on Operation Hastings.
You weren't even in country.

658
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:18,710
Eat shit and die, you fucking
Spanish-American poge!

659
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,240
I was there! I was in the shit
with the grunts.

660
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,130
Don't listen to Payback's bullshit,
Rafterman.

661
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,550
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

662
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,250
You listen to Joker.

663
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,890
He knows ti ti.

664
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,300
Very little.

665
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,140
He's never been in the shit
'cause he ain't got the stare.

666
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,550
The 1,000-yard stare.

667
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,650
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit too long.

668
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:49,030
It's like, it's like you've
really seen beyond.

669
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,350
I got it.

670
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,560
All field Marines got it.
And you'll have it, too.

671
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,210
I will?

672
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,630
How do you stop five blacks
from raping a white chick?

673
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,260
Fuck you.

674
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,180
Throw them a basketball.

675
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,010
Incoming.

676
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:15,060
They're outgoing!

677
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,560
-That ain't outgoing!
-That ain't outgoing!

678
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,170
Now what'd I just say?

679
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,470
I hope they're just fucking with us.

680
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,480
I ain't ready for this shit.

681
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,510
Cease fire!

682
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,370
Cease fire!

683
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,250
The enemy...

684
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,050
...has very deceitfully...

685
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:30,180
...taken advantage of the ceasefire...

686
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,730
...to launch an offensive
all over the country.

687
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:37,400
So far, we've had it pretty easy here.

688
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,520
But we seem to be the exception.

689
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:45,490
Charlie has hit every military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

690
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,390
In Saigon...

691
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:51,900
...the United States Embassy has been
overrun by suicide squads.

692
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,030
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

693
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,710
We have reports that a division of N.V.A....

694
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:05,580
...has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

695
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,010
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

696
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:12,790
...the civilian press are
wetting their pants...

697
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:16,920
...and even Cronkite is going to say
the war is now unwinnable.

698
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,830
In other words...

699
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:24,210
...it's a huge shit sandwich
and we all have to take a bite.

700
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,360
Does this mean Ann-Margret's
not coming?

701
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,020
You go straight up to Phu Bai.

702
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,450
Captain January will need you.

703
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,320
And you take off that damn button.

704
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,990
You can't get killed
wearing a peace symbol.

705
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,500
Permission to go with Joker.

706
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,590
Granted.

707
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,010
Sir, permission not to take Rafterman.

708
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,020
You still here?

709
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,930
Vanish ricky-tick
and take Rafterman with you.

710
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,420
You're responsible for him.

711
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,900
Get some! Get some!

712
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,310
Get some, baby!

713
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,840
I've got you, mother!

714
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,100
Anyone who runs is a VC.

715
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,870
Anyone who stands still...

716
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,710
...is a well-disciplined VC.

717
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,370
You guys ought to do a story about me.

718
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,890
Why should we do a story about you?

719
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,430
'Cause I'm so fucking good!

720
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,720
That ain't no shit neither.

721
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:02,190
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

722
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,820
And 50 water buffaloes, too.

723
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,440
Them are all certified.

724
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,280
Any women or children?

725
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,240
Sometimes.

726
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,530
How can you kill women and children?

727
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,070
Easy.

728
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,630
You just don't lead them so much.

729
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:25,920
Ain't war hell?

730
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,980
We want to get in the shit.

731
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,850
Down the road. Two-five.

732
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,730
Outstanding! Thanks.

733
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:40,520
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

734
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,520
I got a bro named Cowboy.

735
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:44,030
You people one-one?

736
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,900
No, sir. We're reporters
for "Stars and Stripes."

737
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,580
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

738
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:53,370
He's just down the road
in the platoon area.

739
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,050
May we tag along, sir?

740
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:56,960
No problem. Welcome aboard.

741
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:00,260
I'm Schinoski. Walter J. Schinoski.

742
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,850
They call me Mr. Touchdown.

743
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,390
I played ball for Notre Dame.

744
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:09,030
You here to make Cowboy famous?

745
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,770
Never happen, sir.

746
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:14,650
If you came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

747
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:18,240
We got Condition Red and we expect rain.

748
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:21,320
Outstanding. We taking care of business?

749
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,380
The N.V.A. are dug in deep.

750
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:27,850
Hotel Company is working this side
of the river, house by house.

751
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:32,730
Charles has his shit together,
but we're still getting some decent kills.

752
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:36,530
We heard the N.V.A. executed
a lot of gook civilians.

753
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:38,620
Affirmative.

754
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:42,610
I saw bodies half a klick
this side of the canal.

755
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,530
Can you show me where?

756
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:14,120
The dead have been covered with lime.

757
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,010
The dead know only one thing.:

758
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,220
It is better to be alive.

759
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:35,360
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

760
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,370
What outfit are you with?

761
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,430
We're from "Stars and Stripes."

762
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,800
I'm Sergeant Joker
and this photographer is Rafterman.

763
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,680
I'm Lt. Cleves. Hartford, Connecticut.

764
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:48,560
Have you got a body count, sir?

765
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:49,610
Twenty.

766
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,770
How did it happen, sir?

767
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,170
The N.V.A. came in
with a list of gook names:

768
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,170
Government officials, policemen,
ARVN officers, teachers.

769
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:05,540
They asked them, real polite, to report
the next day for political re-education.

770
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,340
Everybody who turned up got shot.

771
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,270
Some they buried alive.

772
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,620
What is that button on your body armor?

773
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:21,540
A peace symbol, sir.

774
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,250
-Where did you get it?
-I don't remember, sir.

775
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,610
What is written on your helmet?

776
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,170
"Born to Kill," sir.

777
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:31,340
You put "Born to Kill" on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

778
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,390
Is that some kind of sick joke?

779
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,310
Well, what does it mean?

780
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,590
-I don't know, sir.
-You don't know very much.

781
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,220
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will shit on you!

782
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,060
Answer my question
or you'll stand tall before the Man.

783
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:50,590
I was referring to the duality of man, sir.

784
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,920
The duality of man.
The Jungian thing, sir.

785
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,440
-Whose side are you on?
-Our side, sir.

786
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:59,410
-Don't you love your country?
-Yes, sir.

787
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:03,460
Then get with the program. Jump on
the team and come in for the big win.

788
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:08,890
I ask that my Marines obey my orders
as they would the word of God.

789
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:12,610
We are helping the Vietnamese,
because inside every gook...

790
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:14,760
...is an American trying to get out.

791
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,210
It's a hardball world, son.

792
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,510
We must keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

793
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,280
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

794
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,700
Around the back.

795
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,830
-First Platoon?
-Through there.

796
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:14,720
Hey, Lone Ranger.

797
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:20,590
Holy shit!

798
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:32,400
I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit!

799
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,100
What's happening?

800
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,350
Just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

801
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:40,820
Why go back?

802
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,660
Here or there, samey-same.

803
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,610
-Been getting any?
-Only your sister.

804
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:48,110
Better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

805
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,210
Hey, you hogs, listen up!

806
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:55,300
This is my bro, Joker, from the island.
And this is....

807
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:00,500
They're from "Stars and Stripes."
You'll be famous.

808
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:05,850
We're the Lusthog squad.
We're lifetakers and heartbreakers.

809
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,590
We shoot holes in them
and fill them with lead.

810
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,650
Are you a photographer?

811
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:21,020
I'm a combat correspondent.

812
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,500
You seen much combat?

813
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,910
I've seen a little on TV.

814
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:36,220
You're a real comedian.

815
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,320
Well, they call me the Joker.

816
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:44,330
Well, I've got a joke for you.

817
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,330
I'm going to tear you a new asshole.

818
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:52,720
Well, pilgrim...

819
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,780
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit!

820
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,490
You talk the talk.

821
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:08,750
Do you walk the walk?

822
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,170
You might not believe it...

823
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:20,300
...but under fire, Animal Mother
is a truly fine human being.

824
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:24,670
He just needs grenades thrown
at him the rest of his life.

825
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:37,100
Jungle bunny. Thank God
for the sickle cell, huh?

826
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,310
Yeah, Mother.

827
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,440
Hey, photographer!

828
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,210
Want to take a good picture?

829
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:50,630
Take this.

830
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:01,480
This...is my bro.

831
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,620
This is his party.

832
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:16,200
He's the guest of honor.

833
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,410
Today is his birthday.

834
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:22,670
Happy birthday, zipperhead!

835
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,530
I will never forget this day.

836
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:31,220
The day I came to Hue city
and fought one million N.V.A. gooks.

837
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,470
I really love the little Commie bastards.

838
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,260
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

839
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:44,090
These are great days we're living!

840
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,140
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

841
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:53,040
These people we wasted here today...

842
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:56,200
...are the finest people we will ever know.

843
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:02,710
Once we rotate back to the world, we'll
miss not having anyone worth shooting.

844
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:41,830
Delta 6 Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

845
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:54,140
We are receiving incoming fire
from the ville.

846
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,260
The lieutenant is down.

847
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,940
We'll stop and check out
what's in front of us.

848
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,780
Okay, Lusthog squad, listen up!

849
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,800
We'll move up these two roads.

850
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,010
I want the third team up this road.

851
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,620
First and second team behind me
up this other road.

852
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:18,930
Let's go! Let's get it done!

853
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,850
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

854
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:52,190
Start the cameras.
This is "Vietnam: The Movie"!

855
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:54,620
If Joker is John Wayne, I'm a horse!

856
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:57,490
-T.H.E. Rock can be a rock!
-I'll be Ann-Margret!

857
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,580
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo!

858
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,280
-I'll be General Custer!
-Who'll be the Indian?

859
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,910
We'll let the gooks play the Indians!

860
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:45,040
You're going home now.

861
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:50,550
Semper fi.

862
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:55,920
We're mean Marines, sir.

863
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,330
Go easy, bros.

864
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:07,720
Better you than me.

865
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:14,230
At least they died for a good cause.

866
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,020
What cause was that?

867
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,310
Freedom.

868
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,780
Flush out your head gear, New Guy.

869
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,610
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

870
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,950
This is a slaughter.

871
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:36,170
If I get my balls blown off for a word...

872
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:40,090
...my word is "poontang."

873
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,680
Tough break for Hand Job.

874
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,150
He was set to get shipped out
on a medical.

875
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:54,120
What was wrong with him?

876
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:58,870
He was jerking off ten times a day.

877
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:03,960
It's no shit. At least ten times a day.

878
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:10,870
Last week he was sent to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

879
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,420
The crazy fucker jerks off
in the waiting room.

880
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,600
Instant Section 8.

881
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,970
He was waiting for his papers
to clear division.

882
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,190
Ready?

883
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,510
Turnover.

884
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:32,820
Hue city interviews. Roll 34.

885
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:40,240
This is a major city,
so we have to assault with...

886
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,080
...tanks in the streets.

887
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:45,360
They send us in first squad...

888
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:48,290
...to make sure there are no little, uh...

889
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:53,330
...Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

890
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:58,040
So we roll the tanks in and basically,
blow the place to hell.

891
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,770
When we're in Hue, in Hue city...

892
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:04,900
...it's like a war, you know.

893
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:10,780
Like what I thought about, what I
thought a war was supposed to be.

894
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,950
There's the enemy, kill them.

895
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,470
There's no question about it.
We're the best.

896
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:24,430
It's bullshit about Air Cav. When
the shit hits the fan, who do they call?

897
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,350
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine!

898
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:30,640
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

899
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:34,930
I don't know. I belong in Vietnam,
I'll tell you that.

900
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:37,570
Can I quote L.B.J.?

901
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,330
"I will not send...

902
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:45,600
"...American boys 10,000 miles
around the world...

903
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,930
"...to do a job Asian boys
should be doing for themselves."

904
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,320
Personally, I think...

905
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,640
...they don't want to be involved
in this war.

906
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,060
I think they sort of...

907
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:04,870
...took away our freedom and gave it
to the gooks. They don't want it.

908
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,920
They'd rather be alive than free.

909
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:09,670
Poor dumb bastards.

910
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,220
The ones I'm fighting at are some pretty...

911
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:17,460
...pretty bad boys. I'm not real, uh....

912
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,730
I'm not real keen on...

913
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:24,550
...these fellows that are supposedly
on our side.

914
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:28,110
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

915
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,820
We get killed for these people
and they don't even appreciate it.

916
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:39,270
They think it's a big joke.

917
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:41,400
If you ask me...

918
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:44,570
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

919
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,920
It depends. I'm here
to take combat photos.

920
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:51,700
But if the shit gets too thick,
I'll go to the rifle.

921
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:56,180
What do I think of America's involvement
in the war?

922
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,760
I think we should win.

923
01:21:58,640 --> 01:21:59,840
I hate Vietnam.

924
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:04,190
There's not one horse
in the whole country.

925
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,690
There's something wrong with that.

926
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,360
If they'd send us more guys maybe...

927
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:14,700
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

928
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,540
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam...

929
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,030
...the jewel of Southeast Asia.

930
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:22,920
I wanted to meet...

931
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:26,310
...interesting people of an ancient culture
and kill them.

932
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:32,340
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

933
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,680
'Morning, little schoolgirl.

934
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,340
I'm a little schoolboy, too.

935
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:08,100
-What you got there?
-Do you want No. 1 fuckee?

936
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:12,140
Any of you boys want
No. 1 fuckee?

937
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,810
I'm so horny I can't even get
a piece of hand!

938
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:15,890
Me want suckee.

939
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:20,830
Suckee, fuckee, she give you everything
you want. Long time.

940
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,740
Everything you want! All right!

941
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:25,150
How much, chief?

942
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,490
$15 each.

943
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:31,830
$15 beaucoup money.

944
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:33,740
$5 each.

945
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:36,040
Come on, she love you good.

946
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,370
Boom-boom long time. $10.

947
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:39,500
$5.

948
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:40,930
No, $10.

949
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,290
Trade you some ARVN rifles.

950
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,970
Never been fired and only dropped once.

951
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,030
Okay, $5. You give me.

952
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:54,580
Let's get mounted.

953
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,280
Something wrong, chief?

954
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:03,450
She says no boom-boom with you.

955
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,120
What the motherfuck?

956
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,550
She says soul brother too beaucoup.

957
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:13,220
He's saying you black boys
pack too much meat!

958
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,740
She looks like she could suck
the chrome off a trailer hitch.

959
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,530
She say too beaucoup. Too beaucoup.

960
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:28,670
Excuse me, ma'am.

961
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,350
What we have here is a magnificent...

962
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:36,140
...specimen of pure Alabama blacksnake.

963
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:38,890
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

964
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:41,520
Okay. Okay.

965
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,850
-We need a batting order.
-I'm going first.

966
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:54,240
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

967
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:57,820
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

968
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:04,540
Hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

969
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:07,930
-I don't want it after you, man!
-Fuck you!

970
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:43,140
Intelligence passed the word down...

971
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:46,890
...that during the night the N. V.A.
pulled out of our area...

972
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,430
...to positions across the Perfume River.

973
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:53,900
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

974
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:28,620
Face outboard and take cover! Do it!

975
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:53,760
He ain't going to make it.

976
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,190
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

977
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:12,040
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

978
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:17,330
Murph, this is Cowboy.

979
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,210
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

980
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:23,300
Wait one.

981
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:31,230
You're senior NCO. Take charge
and continue with the patrol.

982
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,810
Call in at the next checkpoint. Over.

983
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:35,810
Roger. Understand.

984
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,820
I'm squad leader.

985
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,320
I'll follow you anywhere, scumbag.

986
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,080
He's dead.

987
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:45,790
What's up?

988
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:48,830
We made a mistake at the last checkpoint.

989
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:51,370
See what you think.

990
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:56,260
I think we're here...

991
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:59,850
...and we should be here.

992
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:03,480
We're here?

993
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:06,100
We should be here?

994
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,370
What do you think?

995
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:26,470
I think we should change direction.

996
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,740
We'll change direction.

997
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:56,600
What's up?

998
01:29:57,490 --> 01:29:58,910
Change in direction.

999
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,280
Are we lost?

1000
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:03,370
Joker, shut the fuck up!

1001
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:06,290
Okay, listen up!

1002
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,450
Can you hear me?

1003
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:11,130
We're changing direction.

1004
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,210
We're heading over that way.

1005
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:15,760
Eightball's going to find a way through.

1006
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:18,010
Got it?

1007
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:22,050
Eightball, let's dance.

1008
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,670
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1009
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:45,440
Cease fire!

1010
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:47,400
Cease fire, goddamn it!

1011
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:50,070
Cool it, goddamn it! Cease fire!

1012
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:57,360
Listen up! Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1013
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:00,740
Negative!

1014
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:03,660
Save your ammo!
Nobody fire till I tell you!

1015
01:32:07,130 --> 01:32:09,260
No! Cease fire! Cease fire!

1016
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,210
Animal, cease fire!

1017
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:13,180
It's Sergeant Murphy.

1018
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:15,300
Cowboy. Over.

1019
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,480
Murphy. What is your present position?
Over.

1020
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Receiving enemy sniper fire.

1021
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,710
Eightball is down.

1022
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,630
We're half a klick north
of checkpoint No. 4.

1023
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,420
Possible strong enemy forces in front of us.

1024
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,250
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1025
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,270
Roger. Understand.

1026
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:37,600
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1027
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:41,610
Stay close.

1028
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:47,160
Listen up! I think we're being
set up for an ambush.

1029
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:50,960
There may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings.

1030
01:32:51,450 --> 01:32:53,330
I've requested tank support.

1031
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,840
We'll sit tight...

1032
01:32:55,290 --> 01:32:58,080
...but keep our eyes open.
If they hit us...

1033
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:00,260
...we'll have to pull back fast.

1034
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,430
Goddamn it! Cease your fire, Mother!

1035
01:33:04,770 --> 01:33:06,360
Cease your fucking fire!

1036
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,780
We can't leave him !

1037
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:11,490
We'll get him when the tank comes up.

1038
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:14,030
He's hit three times! He can't wait!

1039
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:18,990
That sniper's just trying
to suck us in one at a time.

1040
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,000
Goddamn it! No!

1041
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:26,750
Goddamn it, cease fire!

1042
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,260
Fuck this shit!
I'm going in to bring him out!

1043
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:32,850
Sit the fuck down, goddamn it!

1044
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:52,160
Okay, cease fire! He's there!

1045
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:09,470
Hold your fire!

1046
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,010
Hold your fire!

1047
01:34:12,010 --> 01:34:14,260
You can't see the sniper!

1048
01:34:14,570 --> 01:34:17,950
Save the ammo! Nobody fire
till I tell you! Nobody!

1049
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:25,630
Hold your fire!

1050
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,580
What the fuck do we do now?

1051
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:32,290
Give me that fucking radio.

1052
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,550
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1053
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:45,440
We're in deep shit. Two men down.
What's the story on the tank? Over.

1054
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:48,730
Sorry, Cowboy.

1055
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:50,730
No luck so far with the tank.

1056
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:52,700
Will advise. Over.

1057
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,470
Numb-nut bastards.

1058
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:00,510
Okay, listen up!

1059
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:04,860
Can't wait for the tank.

1060
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,360
They're going to hit us any minute.

1061
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,520
When they do, we won't have time.

1062
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,360
We have to pull out now. Get ready.

1063
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:15,280
Wait! Hold it!

1064
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:17,270
Nobody's pulling out!

1065
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,580
There's only one fucking sniper!

1066
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:20,650
Back off!

1067
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:23,840
I'm calling the plays and I say we pull out!

1068
01:35:24,130 --> 01:35:25,930
What about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1069
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:29,640
It's shitty, but we can't refuse
to accept the situation.

1070
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:32,230
We're not leaving them out there!

1071
01:35:32,370 --> 01:35:33,950
They're wasted!

1072
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:35,670
You know that!

1073
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:38,260
Come on, we gotta bring them back.

1074
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:39,710
Let's do it!

1075
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:42,080
Stand down! That's a direct order.

1076
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:49,220
Fuck you, Cowboy!
Fuck all you assholes!

1077
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:53,650
Goddamn it!

1078
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,410
Fucking son of a bitch!

1079
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:57,400
You motherfucker!

1080
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:20,030
Where's the sniper?

1081
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:25,860
Doc, where's the sniper?

1082
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:36,170
Shit!

1083
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,310
Shit! Fuck!

1084
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,900
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted!

1085
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:39,870
There's only one sniper!

1086
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:44,280
Move up the squad!
You're clear up to here!

1087
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:51,670
Son of a bitch.

1088
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:03,680
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
come with me. We'll take a look.

1089
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,650
You stay put and cover our ass!

1090
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:09,030
We may come back in a big hurry!

1091
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:13,070
-I'm going with you.
-I'm coming, too.

1092
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,150
All set?

1093
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:17,860
Let's move!

1094
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:01,340
Top of the building, round the corner.

1095
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,980
Give me that radio.

1096
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:28,080
This is Cowboy. Over.

1097
01:39:39,310 --> 01:39:42,440
Holy shit! The sniper has a clean shot
through the hole!

1098
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,130
That son of a bitch!

1099
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:59,640
You'll be all right.

1100
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:01,980
Don't shit me, Joker!

1101
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:05,770
I'm not. You're my favorite turd.

1102
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:15,250
Hang on, man! Hang on!

1103
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:20,750
I can hack it.

1104
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:29,830
I can hack it.

1105
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:29,370
Let's go get some payback.

1106
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:37,120
Okay.

1107
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:54,640
Watch that fucking hole.

1108
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:57,630
Give them some smoke.

1109
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:14,910
Ready?

1110
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,950
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1111
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:07,000
Joker, in there! New Guy!

1112
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:13,800
We got the sniper!

1113
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:52,590
What's up?

1114
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:56,010
We got the sniper.

1115
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:10,690
I saved Joker's ass.

1116
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:12,610
I got the sniper.

1117
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:15,530
I fucking blew her away!

1118
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:18,580
Am I bad?

1119
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:22,290
Am I a life-taker?
Am I a heartbreaker?

1120
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:42,320
What's she saying?

1121
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:47,860
She's praying.

1122
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:54,660
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1123
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:00,800
There's nothing we can do for her.

1124
01:47:02,770 --> 01:47:04,070
She's dead meat.

1125
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:13,620
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1126
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:19,670
What about her?

1127
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:25,010
Fuck her.

1128
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:27,980
Let her rot.

1129
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,870
We can't just leave her here.

1130
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:51,680
Hey, asshole...

1131
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,210
...Cowboy's wasted.

1132
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,390
You're fresh out of friends.

1133
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:01,020
I'm running this squad now.

1134
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:04,230
And I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1135
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:11,280
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1136
01:48:14,450 --> 01:48:17,000
I'm just saying we can't leave her like this.

1137
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,770
Shoot...me.

1138
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:33,570
Shoot...

1139
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:35,730
...me.

1140
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:50,460
If you want to waste her, go on...

1141
01:48:53,590 --> 01:48:54,710
...waste her.

1142
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,310
Shoot.

1143
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:15,830
We'll have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of...Ugly!

1144
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:21,670
Hardcore, man.

1145
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:26,150
Fucking hardcore.

1146
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:48,130
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

1147
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:53,670
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1148
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:06,900
"We play fair and we work hard
And we're in harmony

1149
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:11,410
"M-l-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E

1150
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:19,250
"Forever let us hold our banner high

1151
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:22,970
"Boys and girls from far and near

1152
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:24,890
"You're welcome as can be

1153
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:29,230
"M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E

1154
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:32,060
"Who's the leader of the club...."

1155
01:51:32,690 --> 01:51:36,480
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1156
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:42,070
...about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming fuck fantasy.

1157
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:46,120
I am so happy that I am alive...

1158
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:48,880
...in one piece, and short.

1159
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:53,360
I'm in a world of shit, yes.

1160
01:51:54,270 --> 01:51:55,690
But I am alive.

1161
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,060
And I am not afraid.
