    "Known Issue: there are times when the resulting waveform is longer than original length + breaks.\n",

    "Workaround: this will result in longer clips and overlapping with the following event. Can be seen in the logs and speech breaks can be adjusted.\n",
    "Add breaks before each sentence and in the end of a sentences. To avoid long weird pauses and occasionally truncated the end of the clip."
